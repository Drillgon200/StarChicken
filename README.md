# StarChicken
Engine tech built with Vulkan and C++, for education.

This is a game development educational project. That means minimal dependencies and libraries used (will remove glm and glfw eventually in favor of my own math and platform specific window libraries), no bought assets or anything like that, and the primary goal is not to produce a good game.

Vulkan Shooter is an almost line for line implementation of https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ and an early testing ground for fibers, it's nice to have a reference for a vulkan renderer that works. It's safe to ignore it.

All assets and code are completely free to use without credit.
