# StarChicken
Engine tech built with Vulkan and C++, for education.

This is a game development educational project. That means minimal dependencies and libraries used, no bought assets or anything like that, and the primary goal is not to produce a good game.

This is my first venture into C++ and vulkan, and all the fun things that come with it like assembly and heavy multithreading. Please don't kill me if the code is too bad.

Vulkan Shooter is an almost line for line implementation of https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ (example is as well, not sure why I have two) and an early testing ground for fibers, it's nice to have a reference for a vulkan renderer that works. It's safe to ignore it.

All assets and code are completely free to use without credit.
